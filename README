Quick-and-dirty first attempt at finding a way to avoid having to tweak
my TextMate bundles to my preferences every time I set up a new system.
The GitHub and RSpec bundles actually have their own repositories, viz:

  git://github.com/gtcaz/github-tmbundle.git
  git://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle.git

...but I've smashed them into this one. (I did say "quick-and-dirty".)
